# Spring Boot Hexagonal Architecture API

This project is a demonstration of a RESTful API built with Spring Boot using the hexagonal architecture pattern. The hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters, emphasizes separation of concerns and testability by structuring the application into several layers.

## Features
